# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Molule 1 Challenge: 
This project was designed to teach proper usage of html, css, and git as well as how to refactor existing code. 

Redundant html and css elements were removed to produce cleaner code that still funchions but is compatable with sceen readers. Additionally, notes were left in the code to help future developers.

Lastly, one bug fix was found during refactoring. The Seatch Engine Optimization link in the header wasn't working. The link is now functioning properly.
